# Scheduler-with-NodeJS

## Here's a basic implementation of the scheduler and script you described using Node.js and the node-cron library for scheduling tasks:

### Note that the dateTime field in each event is currently set to "* * * * *", which means the trigger function will run every minute. You can change this field to any valid cron expression to schedule the events at the desired time.

### This code uses the node-cron library to schedule the events and the axios library to make HTTP requests, if necessary. The triggerFunction simulates the trigger by logging the text and then waiting for a duration based on the length of the text. The sleep function is used to wait for a specified duration.
